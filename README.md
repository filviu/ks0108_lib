KS0108 Graphics Library for PIC16F microcontrollers 

The project is based on the source found here:

http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/

The source is made pretty universal, still it took some work and modifications to have it working in mikroC. The archive is a ready working project for mikroC.

I tested and developed it on the EasyPIC5 development board with a PIC16F887 microcontroller. You have to have the board  configured for the touchscreen panel and GLCD display â€“ i suppose you know how to do that, if not you should consult the EasyPIC5 manual.
